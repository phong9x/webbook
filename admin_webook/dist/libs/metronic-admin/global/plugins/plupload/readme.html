<h1 id="plupload">Plupload</h1>
<p>Plupload is a cross-browser multi-runtime file uploading API. Basically, a set of tools that will help you to 
build a reliable and visually appealing file uploader in minutes.</p>
<p>Historically, Plupload comes from a dark and hostile age of no HTML5, hence all the alternative fallbacks, 
like Flash, Silverlight and Java (still in development). It is meant to provide an API, that 
will work anywhere and in any case, in one way or another. While having very solid fallbacks, Plupload 
is built with the future of HTML5 in mind.</p>

<h3 id="backstory">Backstory</h3>
<p>Plupload started in a time when uploading a file in a responsive and customizable manner was a real pain. 
Internally, browsers only had the <code>input[type=&quot;file&quot;]</code> element. It was ugly and clunky at the same time. 
One couldn&#39;t even change it&#39;s visuals, without hiding it and coding another one on top of it from scratch. 
And then there was no progress indication for the upload process... Sounds pretty crazy today.</p>
<p>It was very logical for developers to look for alternatives and writing their own implementations, using 
Flash and Java, in order to somehow extend limited browser capabilities. And so did we, in our search for 
a reliable and flexible file uploader for 
our <a href="http://www.tinymce.com/index.php">TinyMCE</a>&#39;s
<a href="http://www.tinymce.com/enterprise/mcimagemanager.php">MCImageManager</a>. </p>
<p>Quickly enough though, Plupload grew big.  It easily split into a standalone project. 
With major <em>version 2.0</em> it underwent another huge reconstruction, basically 
<a href="http://blog.moxiecode.com/2012/11/28/first-public-beta-plupload-2/">from the ground up</a>, 
as all the low-level runtime logic has been extracted into separate <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/">File API</a> 
and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/">XHR L2</a> pollyfills (currently known under combined name of <a href="https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie">mOxie</a>), 
giving Plupload a chance to evolve further.</p>
<p><a name="structure" /></p>
<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>Currently, Plupload may be considered as consisting of three parts: low-level pollyfills, 
Plupload API and Widgets (UI and Queue). Initially, Widgets were meant only to serve as examples 
of the API, but quickly formed into fully-functional API implementations that now come bundled with 
the Plupload API. This has been a source for multiple misconceptions about the API as Widgets were 
easily mistaken for the Plupload itself. They are only implementations, such as any of you can 
build by yourself out of the API.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie">Low-level pollyfills (mOxie)</a> - have their own <a href="https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie">code base</a> and <a href="https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/wiki">documentation</a> on GitHub.</li>

<h3 id="building-instructions">Building instructions</h3>
<p>Plupload depends on File API and XHR2 L2 pollyfills that currently have their 
<a href="https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie">own repository</a> on GitHub. However, in most cases you shouldn&#39;t 
care as we bundle the latest build of mOxie, including full and minified JavaScript source and 
pre-compiled <code>SWF</code> and <code>XAP</code> components, with <a href="https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/releases">every release</a>. You can find everything you may need under <code>js/</code> folder.</p>
<p>There are cases where you might need a custom build, for example free of unnecessary runtimes, half the 
original size, etc. The difficult part of this task comes from mOxie and its set of additional runtimes 
that require special tools on your workstation in order to compile. 
Consider <a href="https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie#build-instructions">build instructions for mOxie</a> - 
everything applies to Plupload as well.</p>
<p>First of all, if you want to build custom Plupload packages you will require <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, 
as this is our build environment of choice. Node.js binaries (as well as Source)
<a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">are available</a> for all major operating systems.</p>
<p>Plupload includes <em>mOxie</em> as a submodule, it also depends on some other repositories for building up it&#39;s dev
environment - to avoid necessity of downloading them one by one, we recommended you to simply clone Plupload 
with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> recursively (you will require git installed on your system for this operation 
to succeed):</p>
<pre><code>git clone --recursive https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload.git
</code></pre><p>And finalize the preparation stage with: <code>npm install</code> - this will install all additional modules, including those
required by dev and test environments. In case you would rather keep it minimal, add a <code>--production</code> flag.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Currently, for an unknown reason, locally installed Node.js modules on Windows, may not be automatically 
added to the system PATH. So, if <code>jake</code> commands below are not recognized you will need to add them manually:</p>
<pre><code>set PATH=%PATH%;%CD%\node_modules\.bin\
</code></pre><p><a name="support" /></p>
<h3 id="support">Support</h3>
<p>We are actively standing behind the Plupload and now that we are done with major rewrites and refactoring,
the only real goal that we have ahead is making it as reliable and bulletproof as possible. We are open to 
all the suggestions and feature requests. We ask you to file bug reports if you encounter any. We may not 
react to them instantly, but we constantly bear them in my mind as we extend the code base.</p>
<p>In addition to dedicated support for those who dare to buy our OEM licenses, we got 
<a href="http://www.plupload.com/punbb/index.php">discussion boards</a>, which is like an enormous FAQ, 
covering every possible application case. Of course, you are welcome to file a bug report or feature request, 
here on <a href="https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/issues">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is easier to notice the problem when bug report is accompained by the actual code. Consider providing 
<a href="https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/wiki/Create-a-Fiddle">a Plupload fiddle</a> for the troublesome code.</p>
